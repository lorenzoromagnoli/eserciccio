                    "Why, what are you saying? Those gentlemen are not satis ed with following my master and suspecting his honour, but they must try to put obstacles in his way! I blush for them!" "What do you mean?" "I mean that it is a piece of shameful trickery. They
                    might as well waylay Mr. Fogg and put his money in their pockets!" "That's just what we count on doing." "It's a conspiracy, then," cried Passepartout, who became more and more excited as the liquor mounted in his head, for he drank
                    without perceiving it. "A real conspiracy! And gentlemen, too. Bah!" Fix began to be puzzled. "Members of the Reform Club!" continued Passepartout. "You must know, Monsieur Fix, that my master is an honest man, and that, when he makes
                    a wager, he tries to win it fairly!" "But who do you think I am?" asked Fix, looking at him intently. "Parbleu! An agent of the members of the Reform Club, sent out here to interrupt my master's journey. But, though I found you out
                    some time ago, I've taken good care to say nothing about it to Mr. Fogg." "He knows nothing, then?" "Nothing," replied Passepartout, again emptying his glass. The detective passed his hand across his forehead, hesitating before he
                    spoke again. What should he do? Passepartout's mistake seemed sincere, but it made his design more di cult. It was evident that the servant was not the master's accomplice, as Fix had been inclined to suspect. "Well," said the detective
                    to himself, "as he is not an accomplice, he will help me." He had no time to lose: Fogg must be detained at Hong Kong, so he resolved to make a clean breast of it.
